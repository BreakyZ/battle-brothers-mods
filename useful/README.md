# Useful Things

Some things are not useful enough, i.e. named goblin weapons, like too weak compared even to top-grade non-named weapons. This mod seeks to fix that. Also makes some things, like throwing nets, just more robust:

- throwing nets are automatically repaired for 6 ammo each after combat and do not prevent double grop anymore, they are simply hanging on a shoulder, common. Also, netted nachezers cannot swallow anymore.
- hand to hand gets more damage overall, direct damage, chance to hit with a bro level. Also applies extra fatigue on hit starting from level 3, up to 10, like a mace on level 12.
- named goblin bows apply goblin poison on hit, and have increased direct damage. This makes them nice alternatives to war bows, making these still less strong but useful in other ways
- named goblin spears has 1 AP cost reduction on their skills, i.e. 3 AP for thrust.
- named goblin falchions always get +10% accuracy, better direct damage and armor mult
- all sort of two handed flails get slightly increased damage and armor mult plus 50% and 30% stun chance on Pound and Thresh for masters of flail. Makes flails more competitive with other 2h weapons while still keeping their somewhat unpredictable behavior.
