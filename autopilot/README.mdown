# Autopilot Mod

*This is authored by AdamMil01 and modified by me. Original version is available [here](original)*

This mod adds some automation and quality-of-life improvements to battles: fast item switching, auto-passing, auto-shieldwalling (and other skills), ignoring bros, and AI control. See fuller description on Nexus Mods page above.

My modifications include:

- use rally the troops
- pick up a weapon
- use nets
- shield wall and split shields less
- use adrenalin, line breaker, lunge skills

Additions:

- a way to debug ai for bros, not only for enemies

Fixes:

- way rarer battle crashes after ranged unit killing enemy 
- second row guys more aggressive
- immediately act after switching to auto, no skipping turn anymore


## Install
