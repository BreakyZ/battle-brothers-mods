# Standout Enemies Mod

Randomly adds some quirks to the most common enemies making fighting them less repetitive and more fun. You will fight Stubborn Wiedergangers, Sly Globlins, Agile Raiders and more. These are stronger, so game might be harder a bit. Standout enemies, however, yield moderately more XP.

Number of quirked enemies increases with current day and difficulty. First ones should appear around day 24 and maximum is reached at day 120 on Expert combat difficulty.

I won't list possible things you can encounter, exploring should be more fun.


## Install

Download a zip from [NexusMods][] and put it into `data` dir.


## Tinkering

Put `scripts` dir into Battle Brothers `data` dir. Then:

```bash
cd scripts/!mods_preload
<edit> mod_standout_enemies.nut
```

Optionally you can run a "test", which will at least check syntax and maybe find some typos saving you a couple of game restarts:

```bash
squirrel test_mod_standout_enemies.nut
```

You will need squirrel installed for this to work


## Feedback

This is a first public version. Things should work, but balance might be off. Please open an issue if you have one.

New ideas are also welcome, even though I have some of my own not yet implemented. You can ask or suggest thing on [NexusMods posts][nm-posts]
