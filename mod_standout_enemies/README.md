# Standout Enemies Mod

Randomly adds some quirks to the most common enemies making fighting them less repetitive and more fun. You will fight Fearless Orcs, Stubborn Wiedergangers, Sly Globlins and more. These are stronger, so game might be harder a bit. Standout enemies, however, yield moderately more XP.

Number of quirked enemies increases with current day and combat difficulty. First ones appear around day 25 and maximum scale is reached at day 180. Things randomly fluctuate though.

I won't list possible things you can encounter, exploring should be more fun.


## Install

Download a zip from [NexusMods][] and put it into `data` dir.


## Tinkering

Put `scripts` dir into Battle Brothers `data` dir. Then:

```bash
cd scripts/!mods_preload
<edit> mod_standout_enemies.nut
```

Optionally you can run a "test", which will at least check syntax and maybe find some typos saving you a couple of game restarts:

```bash
squirrel test_mod_standout_enemies.nut
```

You will need squirrel installed for this to work


## Feedback

Things should work, but balance might be off. Please open an issue if you have one.

New ideas are also welcome, even though I have some of my own not yet implemented. You can ask or suggest a thing on [NexusMods posts][nm-posts]
