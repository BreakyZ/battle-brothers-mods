# Standout Enemies Mod

Randomly adds some quirks to the most common enemies making fighting them less repetitive and more fun. You will fight Stubborn Wiedergangers, Sly Globlins, Agile Raiders and more. These are stronger, so game might be harder a bit. Standout enemies, however, yield moderately more XP.

Number of quirked enemies increases with current day and difficulty. First ones should appear around day 24 and maximum is reached at day 120 on Expert combat difficulty.

I won't list possible things you can encounter, exploring should be more fun.

**NOTE:** This is first public version. Things should work, but balance might be off. Please open a bug if you have an issue. New ideas also welcome, even though I have some of my own not yet implemented.
