# Immortal Warriors

You start with several jars containing soul of ancient warriors. These might be used onto your brothers to imbue them with immortal powers, which are configurable :). Upon death the soul is returned to a jar.


## Compatibility

Safe to add midgame, can't remove once you have immortal warriors or their soul jars. You can set the number of Immortal Warriors to 0 in Mod Options instead.

Should be highly compatible with other mods.


## Install

Download a zip from [NexusMods][] and put it into `data` dir. Requires [modhooks][] of version 20 or newer.
