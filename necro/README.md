# Proper Necromancer

Following the idea of [Recrutable Necromancer](old) this adds a Necromancer background, who can raise undead and possess them.

In an addition of simply having a guy who can raise and possess undead this mod:

- raise undead requires more AP and Fatigue, also have limited range to balance it a bit
- prevent loosing loot on friendly zombies
- XP not lost anymore, count kills and damage from zombies as their master's

Plans:

- make Necro gain power gradually via special perks:
    - Necromastery (AP/Fatigue)
    - Possess as perk
    - Mind Meld (share perks with zombies)
    - Double Raise Undead range
    - Zombie skills:
        - Regeneration
        - Blood Sucking
    - Flesh of Iron (restore some armor on raise)
    - Soul Link (share damage with random zombie)
- remove some perks from Necro tree
- check Necro morale when possesed is hit/killed


## Compatibility

Is safe to add midgame, can't remove once you have these guys anywhere including city hiring rosters. Compatible with most other mods.
