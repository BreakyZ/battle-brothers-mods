# Hackflows's Perks

My curated collection of perks inspired by [More Perks][], [True Balance][] and [Stabilized][] mods. The perks were selected, fixed, rebalanced, etc. This contains only 6 new perks in the spirit of less is more approach. The ones that were not taken I consider either duplicating existing perks or traits, hard to balance or just boring.

So here we have:

**Flesh on the Bones:** If the bones are there the flesh will grow. Restores hitpoints at *double rate* unless any bones are broken. Old injuries are fine.

**Bloody Harvest:** Gain *+10%* chance to hit for all area of effect attacks.

**Balance:** Getting hit or missed costs *half* of the usual fatigue.

**Full Force:** Put your full weight into every blow and gain *+1%* minimal melee damage for each *3* fatigue caused by things worn and held. Items in the bag do not contribute.

**Stabilized:** Specialize in medium armor! Hitpoint and armor damage is reduced by *25%* when the total penalty to Maximum Fatigue from head and body armor is between *25* and *37*. Outside this range the bonus drops rapidly. 

**Battle Flow:** The first kill each turn does not accumulate fatigue.


## Compatibility

Safe to add and remove midgame. However, if you remove it when having bros with any of these perks, they will simply disappear, perk points won't be refunded.
