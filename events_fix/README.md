# Events and Ambitions Delayed Fix

Removes unpredicatably long delays before events and ambitions are selected and fired.

Currently Battle Brothers have a bug preventing events and ambitions from occuring while you are going to any enterable location, i.e. a town or a lair, or pursuing an enemy. This means to trigger events you need to either got to a point on a map, stand still, camp or ride caravan.

This resulted in many complaint over the years about ambitions not resolving or coming and events being too rare. This mod allows removes the restrictions explained above, making events and ambitions way more predictable to appear and progress.

Note that this does not make events more frequent and does not remove or reduce other delays, i.e. after combat, between event fire chance checks, between events fired or event specific cooldown. For that you may use the Event Frequency mod, which will be less needed with this fix though.
