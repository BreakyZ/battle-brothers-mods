Keeps some history on your brothers shows it in bro's popups. Shows the same info in obituary popup if bro dies. Currently this is:

- deaths
- chopped or crushed heads and gutted enemies
- max kills in a single battle
- killing your teammates
- injuries dealt and received
- saves by Nine Lives
- battles slacked while other bros fighting
- how many times fleed
