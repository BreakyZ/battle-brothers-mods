# Stupid Game

Some modification for playing Battle Brothers as autobattler. Also requires specific modset:

- Autopilot New (obviously)
- Cheap Meat (because bros die)
- Bro Studio (for bros to die less)
- Tweaks and Fixes: Survivor Nine Lives (tnf_survivorNineLives, for same reason)
- Less Severe Permanent Injuries
- 18 Bros in Battle

Plus any other you like, including Reforged and Legends.

Is safe to add and remove midgame. Compatible with most other mods.
