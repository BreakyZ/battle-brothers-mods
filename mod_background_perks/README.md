# Background Perks Mod

This mod gives brothers a chance to begin with certain perks in the perk tree unlocked by default depending on the background they belong to. Based on [Starting Perks by Background][base-mod].

Changes from the base mod:
- added backgrounds from new DLCs
- vary free perks more
- scale probability by time, later hires have higher chance to get free perks
- don't give adrenaline to everybody
