2.0 (The first rewrite following the original 1.2)
- exclude Drunkard trait but allow Bloodthirsty for masters
- added 1 in 30 limit for very high cost backgrounds, multiplier applies on top
Compatibility:
- made compatibile with mods like Ultra Bros and Starting Perks by Background
- fixed some newer DLC changes overwritten by the original mod
- autodetect ranged origins
- overall better other mods and future compatibility
Math fixes:
- made talent chances calculation to match the description (there was off by 1 error)
- removed hardcoded to 1 in 10 for gladiator origin, ignoring multiplier
- removed integer division rounding in master chance and party strength calculation

Not really:
- fixed trait calculation messing up seeded starts
