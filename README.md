## Installation

The easiest way is to go to [NexusMods][nexus-mods] and download a zip release from there. Some of these mods are not there yet, also here you can find a newest versions (which might be broken, but not usually). Anyway to get the latest version you'll need:

1. Get this locally - either `git clone` or just [download ZIP][zip] and unpack.
2. Go to a subdir of a desired mod.
3. Zip all the dirs there - either manually or execute `make zip`.
4. Put it to `data` folder as usual, make sure removing older zip of the same mod.

## Feedback

Any suggestions, bug reports, other feedback are welcome. The best place for it is this Github, i.e. just create an issue. Or you can post or create a bug on [NexusMods][nexus-mods] on a specific mod page.
