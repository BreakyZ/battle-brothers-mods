# Mod Cheap Meat

So hires cost 50%, recruiter makes them 33%. Tryouts are 50% and 25% respectively.

This mod is aimed to enable quickly trying out different backgrounds, especially useful with [More Backgrounds and Events Mod][custombg]. This obviously significantly simplifies the game, so consider making your life hard back some other way ;) You may try [Standout Enemies mod][se].

You can install it from [nexusmods][] or simply put this `scripts` dir to your `Battle Brothers/data` if you want to tinker with it.
