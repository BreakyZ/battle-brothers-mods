# Veteran Attrs and Perks Mod

Adds an extra perk on certain veteran levels, defaults to 13, 16, 20, 25 and 31. May be configured. Also gives some chance to roll 2 to any skill with talent on veteran levels.

To configure levels with perks open `scripts/!mod_preload/mod_vap.nut` and adjust values at the top of the file.

The attributes idea was taken from [Slight veteran level buff][slightvb] mod.
