# Veteran Attrs and Perks Mod

Veterans will sometimes get better roll than just 1 for attributes they have talents in. Also gives extra perks for veterans at certain levels.

Talents provide 0.16 point per level per star on average compared to 0.5 on non-veteran levels.
Extra perks default to 13, 16, 20, 25 and 31. May be configured or set to every n-th level.

To configure things open `scripts/!mod_preload/mod_vap.nut` and adjust values at the top of the file.

The attributes idea was taken from [Slight veteran level buff][slightvb] mod. Compared to that this is configurable, no longer looses attribute rolls on character screen exit and has other fixes.
