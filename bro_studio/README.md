# Bro Studio

Allows to customize all sort of things during bro generation and level up:
- talents
- perk points
- traits
- attribute gain

Both for new bros and veterans.


## Compatibility

- works with Legends and Reforged
- will probably work with most other mods
- won't work with [Ultra Bros][ultra-bros] - those are broken in too many ways
- won't work with [Veterans Attrs and Perks][veteran-ap] - provides the same functionality anyway

Is safe to add or remove mid-game.


## Install

Download a zip from [NexusMods][] and put it into `data` dir. Requires [Modern Hooks][ModernHooks], [stdlib][] and [MSU][].
